            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="images/profile-picture.webp" alt="A profile picture of Santiago Cahaparro" width="200" loading="lazy">
            <p>My name is Santiago, I'm the second youngest brother of five. 
                I live in Argentina, a beautiful country, but I also like to visit other 
                countries and experience life with different cultures. I recently returned 
                from a mission in Brazil where I had the opportunity to learn Portuguese 
                and meet wonderful people. I am a simple person, that likes to share time 
                with friends and playing sports, for example, I play football (soccer) 
                twice a week with friends and love it. I am a music enthusiast, I like to 
                play different musical instruments, like piano, guitar or ukelele and 
                currently I am learning to play the drums. Since I was very young, I've 
                been always interested in building things using my imagination to solve 
                problems and also liked technology a lot. So now I'm learning to program 
                in different languages, and also learning to develop web pages like this 
                one.

                It is the eighth largest country in the world, with a population of 
                over 44 million people. Argentina is famous for its beef, wine, 
                tango music and dance, and its football (soccer) culture. The 
                country also boasts stunning landscapes, including the Andes
